  # Automated End-to-End Test Suite


  ## Why now?


  Increasing velocity means more frequent releases and higher risk of
  regressions. Manual QA can't keep up. A robust E2E test suite will:


  * Catch breaking changes (UI/API/extension)

  * Enable safe refactoring

  * Accelerate code review and deployment


  ## What we'll deliver


  * E2E Playwright coverage for top 5 user flows (web, API, Chrome extension)

  * CI integration for actionable feedback (GitHub checks)

  * Docs for writing/maintaining tests


  ## Success criteria


  * 

    > 80% coverage of critical flows
  * Build failures when key journeys break

  * 20% reduction in post-release bugs within 1 month


  ## Technical details


  * Use Playwright for multi-browser/web/extension coverage

  * Tests run on PR via GitHub Actions

  * Failure alerts in Slack


  ## Risks and mitigations


  * Flaky tests: require retries + clear error logs

  * Coverage drift: review suite monthly
