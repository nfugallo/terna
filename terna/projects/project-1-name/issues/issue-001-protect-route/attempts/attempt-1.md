# Attempt 1: Setup database schema

## What I tried
1. Created migration file for sequences table
2. Added steps table with foreign key to sequences
3. Attempted to run migration

## What happened
- Migration failed due to missing RLS policies
- Error: `permission denied for schema public`

## Files changed
- `supabase/migrations/001_create_sequences.sql` (created)
- `supabase/migrations/002_create_steps.sql` (created)

## Next steps
Need to add RLS policies before creating tables.
